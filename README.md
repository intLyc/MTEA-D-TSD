## Note

The MTO-Platform (MToP) has incorporated the relevant algorithm at *"[MTO/Algorithms/Multi-objective Multi-task/Multi-population/MTEA-D-TSD/MTEA-D-TSD.m](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/blob/master/MTO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20Multi-task/Multi-population/MTEA-D-TSD/MTEA_D_TSD.m)"* and provides convenient utility functions. We highly recommend using it for code running. [https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform)

The multi-objective sensor coverage problem in the paper have also been uploaded to the MTO-Platform at [Multi-objective Sensor Coverage Problem](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/blob/master/MTO/Problems/Real-world%20Applications/Multiobjective%20Sensor%20Coverage%20Problem/MOSCP.m)
